Big Break is a one-week Spring Break mission experience that happens each year in Panama City Beach, Florida. The Big Break team wanted their Web site redesigned so that it fit with the visual look of print and video materials also produced by my team.

I was inspired by several sites using <a title="Article on Web Designer Wall" href="http://www.webdesignerwall.com/trends/80-large-background-websites/">large image backgrounds</a> as a backdrop to their design. The Future of Web Design NYC site was one that gave me the idea. When I think of this conference, I think of the Florida beach which is one of the selling points of the conference.
